### Feature Extraction :
- Get the video files from video_path
- Load a pre-trained model
- Get the frames using cv2 from the video files
- Preprocess the video frames
- Extract features using a pre-trained model (ResNet18)
- Save the features to disk for training and testing

---
Code block of the `preprocess_frame` function defines an image transformation pipeline using PyTorch's transforms. Let's break down each step:

1. `transforms.ToPILImage()`: 
   - Converts the input frame (likely a numpy array from OpenCV) to a PIL Image format
   - PIL stores image as an object with methods and attributes
   - Internally converts BGR to RGB

2. `transforms.Resize(256)`:
   - Resizes the image to 256x256 pixels while maintaining aspect ratio

3. `transforms.CenterCrop(224)`:
   - Crops the center 224x224 pixels from the resized image
   - This ensures a consistent input size for the neural network

4. `transforms.ToTensor()`:
   - Converts the PIL Image to a PyTorch tensor
   - Also scales the pixel values from [0, 255] to [0, 1]

5. `transforms.Normalize()`:
   - Normalizes the tensor using pre-computed means and standard deviations
   - The values `[0.485, 0.456, 0.406]` and `[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]` are the standard ImageNet normalization parameters (RGB channel mean and std)
   - This standardization helps the model perform better as it was trained on similarly normalized data

This transformation pipeline is standard for models pre-trained on ImageNet (like the ResNet18 being used in this code) and ensures that input images match the format the model expects.

```python
unsqueeze(0):
```
- Adds an extra dimension at index 0 (the batch dimension)
-  Before: tensor shape is [3, 224, 224] (channels, height, width)
- After: tensor shape becomes [1, 3, 224, 224] (batch, channels, height, width)

```python
with torch.no_grad():
```
- Disables gradient calculation
- Reduces memory usage and speeds up computation
- Used during inference since we don't need gradients for backpropagation

### Training important points:

1. **Training Pipeline (train_model function)**:
```python
def train_model(model, train_loader, val_loader, criterion, optimizer, device, num_epochs=25):
```
- Handles the training loop for the specified number of epochs
- Uses PrettyTable to track and display metrics (Loss, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Accuracy)
- For each epoch:
  - Trains the model on training data
  - Evaluates the model on validation data
  - Records metrics

2. **Main Function**:
- Sets up the device (CPU/GPU)
- Creates dataset and splits into train/validation (80/20 split)
- Initializes the VideoSummarizer model, BCE loss, and Adam optimizer
- Trains the model and saves the checkpoint

### Key Components from models.py

1. **VideoSummarizer Class**:
```python
class VideoSummarizer(nn.Module):
```
- Neural network architecture for video summarization using Transformer
- Components:
  - Input projection layer
  - Positional encoding
  - Multi-head self-attention Transformer encoder
  - Output projection layer
- Takes video features as input and outputs importance scores (0-1) for each frame

---

`The model works as follows:`
1. Takes video features `(shape: [batch_size, num_frames, 512])`
2. Projects features to lower dimension `(512 â†’ 256)`
3. Adds positional encoding to maintain sequence order information
4. Processes sequence through Transformer encoder with:
   - Multi-head self-attention (8 heads)
   - Feed-forward networks
   - Layer normalization
   - Residual connections
5. Projects final representations to importance scores (0-1)

The Transformer architecture is particularly suited for video summarization because:
- Self-attention mechanism captures global dependencies between all frames
- Parallel processing of the entire sequence improves efficiency
- Multi-head attention allows the model to focus on different aspects of the frames
- Positional encoding maintains temporal order information
- Layer normalization and residual connections help with training stability

2. **VideoDataset Class**:
```python
class VideoDataset(Dataset):
```
- Handles data loading and preprocessing
- Loads video features and annotations
- Provides padding for variable-length sequences
- Returns features, labels, and attention masks

3. **PSO Class (Particle Swarm Optimization)**:
```python
class PSO:
```
- Used during evaluation for keyshot selection
- Optimizes frame selection based on importance scores
- Converts continuous scores to binary selections (keep/discard frames)

###From eval.py

**evaluate_model Function**:
```python
def evaluate_model(model, test_loader, device):
```
- Evaluates model performance on test/validation data
- Process:
  1. Gets model predictions
  2. Applies PSO for keyshot selection
  3. Calculates metrics:
     - Precision
     - Recall
     - F1-score
     - Accuracy

### Data Flow

1. Video features and annotations are loaded through VideoDataset
2. Data is fed through VideoSummarizer model to get importance scores
3. During training:
   - BCE loss is calculated between predicted and actual importance scores
   - Model parameters are updated through backpropagation
4. During evaluation:
   - PSO converts importance scores to binary selections
   - Metrics are calculated comparing selections with ground truth

This pipeline implements a Transformer-based video summarization system that learns to identify important frames in videos and creates summaries by selecting key shots.
